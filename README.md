#### Project summary

MARISA: Matching Algorithm with Recursively Implemented StorAge

#### Latest version

0.3.0

#### Description

Matching Algorithm with Recursively Implemented StorAge (MARISA) is a static and space-efficient trie data structure. And libmarisa is a C++ library to provide an implementation of MARISA. Also, the package of libmarisa contains a set of command line tools for building and operating a MARISA-based dictionary.

A MARISA-based dictionary supports not only lookup but also reverse lookup, common prefix search and predictive search.

* Lookup is to check whether or not a given string exists in a dictionary.
* Reverse lookup is to restore a key from its ID.
* Common prefix search is to find keys from prefixes of a given string.
* Predictive search is to find keys starting with a given string.

The biggest advantage of libmarisa is that its dictionary size is considerably more compact than others. See below for the dictionary size of other implementations.

  * Source: enwiki-20121101-all-titles-in-ns0.gz
  * Contents: all page titles of English Wikipedia (Nov. 2012)
  * Number of keys: 9,805,576
  * Total size: 200,435,403 bytes (plain) / 54,933,690 bytes (gzipped)

#### Build instructions

You can get the latest version via `git clone`. Then, you can build and install libmarisa and its command line tools via `cmake`. See also documentation for details.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/s-yata/marisa-trie.git
$ cd marisa-trie
$ cmake -S. -Bbuild-rel -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DENABLE_NATIVE_CODE=ON -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF
$ cmake --build build-rel
$ sudo cmake --install build-rel
```

To install just the library without the binaries:

```
$ sudo cmake --install build-rel --component Library
```

To install just the binaries:

```
$ sudo cmake --install build-rel --component Binaries
```
